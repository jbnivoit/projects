How to write Windows Shell extensions using Win32::ShellExt
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. look at the samples provided in the examples/ subdirectory of the distribution

2. start from any one of the .pm files provided there.

3. change the CLSID to a new one : each extension MUST have its own CLSID, in particular
 be careful not to reuse an existing one, or you might break the installation for that
 extension (if it has been installed).

4. change the body of the query_context_menu() and action() methods.
	- query_context_menu() is called by the Explorer to know whether it should should your
	menu entry in the context menu.
	- action() is called when the user clicks on the command in the context menu.

5. installing an extension: start a perl interpreter on the command line, then call the install()
 method as in:
	Win32::ShellExt::<your extension>->install
 This will create the registry keys the Explorer needs to locate your extension (tell it how to 
 load the perl embedding DLL and which CLSID to pass to it, then that DLL will locate the DLL
 using the registry keys created at install() time). There also is an uninstall() method that you
 can call in the same fashion to erase the registry keys for that extension, thereby making the
 Explorer unable to find it anymore.
